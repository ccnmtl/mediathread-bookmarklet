[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ccnmtl/mediathread-bookmarklet.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ccnmtl/mediathread-bookmarklet)

A bookmarklet for importing assets to Mediathread.

This bookmarklet could eventually be phased out due to web browsers' Content Security Policies, see: [Bookmarklets are Dead](https://medium.com/making-instapaper/bookmarklets-are-dead-d470d4bbb626#.a5a1orvpf). Still, it might remain useful if things change, and for sites with lax security headers.
